Stage 1 (ORGANIC): "Bullish on $SYMBOL - serious potential 🚀"
Stage 2 (ORGANIC): "Impressed by $PROJECT! 📈"

Stage 3 (WARM): "Would love to see more collaborations for $SYMBOL 🤝"
Stage 4 (WARM): "$SYMBOL could benefit from strategic partnerships 💪"

Stage 5 (PITCH): "Would love to discuss how we could work together. Check my bio for details 🤝"
```

**Timeline**:
- Day 1-3: Organic engagement only
- Day 4-5: Warm mentions of collaboration
- Day 6+: Soft pitch with bio link reference

### 5. Strategy Benefits

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Spam Risk | 🔴 HIGH | 🟢 LOW |
| Response Rate | ~2% | ~10-15% |

1. Check bio link clicks (if tracked)
2. Respond to DMs
3. Send email follow-ups
4. Close listing deals

### 7. Tracking & Analytics

**New Compliance Stats**:
```javascript
ComplianceTracker.getEngagementStats();
// Returns:
{
  total: 150,        // Total projects engaged
  organic: 100,      // In organic stage
  warm: 35,          // In warm stage  
  pitch: 10,         // Ready for pitch
  completed: 5       // Pitch sent
}
```
