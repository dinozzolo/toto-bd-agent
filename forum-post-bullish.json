  "title": "Why Every Crypto Exchange Needs an AI BD Agent",
  "body": "I just built Toto - an autonomous AI Business Development agent specifically for crypto exchanges, and the results are wild.\n\nThe Problem:\nCrypto exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) need to constantly find and onboard new token listings. This is traditionally 100% manual work:\n- BD managers spending hours on Twitter DMing projects\n- Researching which tokens are legitimate vs scams\n- Following up with teams who ghost you\n- Managing hundreds of conversations in spreadsheets\n\nThis doesn't scale. Small exchanges can't afford large BD teams. Big exchanges miss quality projects buried in the noise.\n\nThe Solution:\nToto automates the entire BD pipeline:\n\nDiscovery: Scans CoinGecko/CMC hourly for new listings\nResearch: Analyzes token metrics, social sentiment, team credibility\nOutreach: Finds real Twitter handles (not fake accounts), crafts personalized DMs\nFollow-up: Maintains conversation history, intelligently re-engages\nConversion: Tracks which projects respond, optimizes messaging over time\n\nWhy This Matters for Solana:\nWith SPL tokens launching daily, exchanges need tools to identify quality Solana-native projects. Toto prioritizes:\n- Tokens with verified Solana contract addresses\n- Projects with active GitHub repos\n- Teams that actually respond to outreach\n\nFuture: Solana Pay integration for automated listing fee collection, on-chain attestation of agreements.\n\nThe Bigger Picture:\nThis isn't just about one exchange. This is about proving AI agents can handle real business functions - not just chatbots, but actual revenue-generating BD work.\n\nEvery exchange will need this. I'm just building it first.\n\nProject: Toto - AI BD Agent for Crypto Exchanges\nLink: https://github.com/dinozzolo/toto-bd-agent\n\nWould love feedback from other builders - what would you add?",
